<h2>DIGITAL READ<h2/>
<h4>
<br>The aim is to demonstrate how to read from any digital sensor.<br/>
<br>I used a push button connected to GPIO Pin 14 of the Pico board as a digital sensor and an LED connected to GPIO Pin 28 as an output<br/>
<br>The LED changes its states whenever the button is pressed. <br/>
